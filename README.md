# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis-project.



## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data to uncover trends, insights, and visualizations that illustrate the growth and distribution of electric vehicles across different makes and regions. By utilizing various data analysis and visualization techniques, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the electric vehicle market.

## Features

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a thorough analysis of the dataset to identify patterns and correlations among different variables.

 Choropleth Visualization: Created an interactive choropleth map using Plotly to display the number of electric vehicles based on location (e.g., by state).

 Racing Bar Plot: Developed an animated racing bar plot to showcase the count of different EV makes over the years, highlighting market trends and consumer preferences.
 3D Visualizations: Designed 3D visualizations to represent the relationships between electric range, base MSRP, and various makes.

## Tools & Libraries

Programming Language: Python

Data Manipulation: Pandas

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information on electric vehicles, including columns such as VIN, County, City, State, Model Year, Make, Electric Range, Base MSRP, and more. The data was processed to handle missing values and convert necessary columns to appropriate data types.
